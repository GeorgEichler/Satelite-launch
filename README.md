**Modelling the launch of a satelite** 

This repository is part of a group coursework for Math Modelling 1 to determine an optimal number of stages and
optimise costs for launching a satellite into orbit.
This involves optimisation methods using a similar stage model and a Lagrange multiplier optimisation approach.
Furthermore, we simulate a rocket launch for both low Earth and geostationary orbit.
